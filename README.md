# Platform Allocation RealTimeTrains Scraper

This is a rust based web scraper for real time trains, focused on actual historic platform allocation. It's original use was to track platform zero calls at Stockport station due to it's irregular patter. 

This is part of my [platform zero](https://roseis.gay/projects/plat0) project.
